# merge bed files into one big file        #
#                                          #
# !Note: before merging make sure!         #
# - all files have the same rows           #
# - all the rows are sorted                #
#                                          #
# The big file will contain:               #
# - each colname: the id of the filename   #
# - col: number of reads                   #
